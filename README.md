# assertlike
- experiments with custom "is equal" assertions using Hamcrest, scoped to test suites in Java (i.e. not overwriting the type's compare)

## Usage
The tests are the illustration of what works and doesn't. If you have an editor that will let you poke at them trivially
I'd recommend that, otherwise `./gradlew test` will do the trick.
